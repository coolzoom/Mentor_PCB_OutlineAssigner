# Outline Assigner

This software helps Xpedition/PADS Pro users to make their life easy and happy when it comes to small but important details.
This software has multiple abilities, many of them are focusing to make some routine operations much quicker (like defining Route Border) but there's some functions which they're very time consuming to do by hand, like defining panel route cuts and Breakaway tabs. 

**Note: Before using Break-Away Tabs functionality, you must import supplied EDX file into your Library.**
